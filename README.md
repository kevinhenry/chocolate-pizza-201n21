# chocolate-pizza-201n21
The Team: Antonius Turnski, Patrick Laurion, and Kevin Henry
We worked on this together to emulate the Chocolate Pizza Webpage.
Antonius was the CSS wiz and gave us a strong start with the header and body.
Patrick worked through the recipe card and overall style.
Kevin worked on the footer and final touch-ups.
We relied on W3 schools for CSS inspiration.
